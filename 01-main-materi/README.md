### 9. Code Reviews and Pair Programming

#### Main-Materi
- **Explanation:** 
  - **Code Reviews:** A code review is a process where developers examine each other's code to identify potential issues, ensure adherence to coding standards, and share knowledge. Code reviews help catch bugs early, improve code quality, and promote learning and collaboration.
  - **Pair Programming:** Pair programming is a collaborative approach where two developers work together on the same codebase. One developer, the "driver," writes the code, while the other, the "navigator," reviews each line of code as it's written. This practice can lead to better code quality and faster problem-solving.

- **Example:**
  - Code Review Scenario:
    ```python
    # Original Code
    def calculate_discount(price, discount_rate):
        return price - (price * discount_rate)

    # Code Review Comments
    # 1. Add type annotations for clarity.
    # 2. Handle edge cases, such as negative prices or discount rates.
    # 3. Add a docstring to explain the function.
    ```

  - Refactored Code After Review:
    ```python
    def calculate_discount(price: float, discount_rate: float) -> float:
        """
        Calculate the discounted price.

        Parameters:
        price (float): The original price.
        discount_rate (float): The discount rate as a decimal.

        Returns:
        float: The discounted price.
        """
        if price < 0 or discount_rate < 0:
            raise ValueError("Price and discount rate must be non-negative.")
        return price - (price * discount_rate)
    ```
