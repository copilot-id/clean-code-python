#### Solve Exercise
- **Answers/Explanations:**
    - Messy Code:
    ```python
    def volCube(l):
        v = l**3
        return v
    side = 3
    print(volCube(side))
    ```

    - Explanation: This code calculates the volume of a cube but lacks meaningful variable names and consistent formatting.

    - Clean Code:
    ```python
    def calculate_volume_cube(side_length: float) -> float:
        """
        Calculate the volume of a cube given its side length.
        """
        volume = side_length**3
        return volume

    side_length = 3
    print(calculate_volume_cube(side_length))
    ```

    - Explanation: The function `calculate_volume_cube` has a descriptive name, and the parameter `side_length` is annotated with its data type (`float`). The variable `volume` is defined for clarity, and the function includes a docstring to explain its purpose. The overall code is properly indented and formatted.
