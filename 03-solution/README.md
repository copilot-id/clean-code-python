#### Solve Exercise
- **Answers/Explanations:**
    - Messy Code:
    ```python
    def read_file(file_path):
        with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
            return file.read()

    try:
        content = read_file('nonexistent_file.txt')
        print(content)
    except Exception as e:
        print("Error:", e)
    ```

    - Explanation: This code attempts to read a nonexistent file, which will raise an exception. The error handling is very generic and doesn't provide specific information about the type of error.

    - Clean Code:
    ```python
    def read_file(file_path: str) -> str:
        """
        Read the contents of a file and handle file-related errors.
        """
        try:
            with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
                return file.read()
        except FileNotFoundError:
            print("Error: The file was not found.")
            return None
        except IOError:
            print("Error: An I/O error occurred.")
            return None

    content = read_file('nonexistent_file.txt')
    if content is not None:
        print(content)
    ```

    - Explanation: The function `read_file` includes specific error handling for `FileNotFoundError` and `IOError`, providing meaningful messages and fallback values (`None`). The parameter and return types are annotated for clarity.
